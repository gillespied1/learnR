## Outline

- Background
- Two key guiding principles
- Expansion and examples
- Discussion and questions
- Summary

<div class="blue2">
**N.B.** I am a medical statistician by background, but concerns are likely to be apparent in other fields and principles should also hold true...
</div>


## Background

Dozens of articles published demonstrating statistical errors:

- Application
- Analysis
- Interpretation
- Reporting
  
**Why might this be a problem?**

- Decision making (and consequences of)?
- Reproducibility?
- Discredited professionals (or *profession*)?

##Guiding principles 

1. Sufficiently detailed statistical methods: <div class="blue2"> *"Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader, with access to the original data, to verify the reported results"* </div>

2. Sufficiently detailed results: <div class="blue2"> *"Provide enough detail that the results can be incorporated into other analyses"* </div>

##Reporting statistical methods

- Describe target sample size and underlying assumptions
<div class="blue2">*Related to pre-specification (see next slide...)*</div>

- Describe *purpose* of each piece of analysis
<div class="blue2">*Hypothesis driven? Hypothesis generating?*</div>


- Describe variables used
<div class="blue2">*How were they measured? Any derivation required?*</div>


- Describe methods used to analyse data
<div class="blue2">*Clustering, missing data, outliers, transformations, etc.*</div>


- Describe software used to analyse data
<div class="blue2">*When using R, also state the package/s used!*</div>


## Pre-specification is important for transparency

- Protocol with description of aims, objectives, and planned analyses in place **prior to starting any analysis**
<div class="blue2">*Publish this in a journal or on a website*</div>

- Descriptions of any deviations from any pre-specified plans
<div class="blue2">*Including date and reason for deviation*</div>

##Reporting statistical results

##An over-reliance on *P* values...

- A function of sample size
- Often reported in isolation (i.e. without context)
- Do not convey effect size
- Too much focus on reporting *statistically significant* findings based on an arbitrary threshold (e.g. 5% or *P* < 0.05)

<p align="center">

</p>

##Some suggested improvements

- State sample size (and reflect against original target)
- Report effect sizes (absolute and relative?)
- Convey uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals, data visualisation)
- Interpret in terms of *meaningful differences* (e.g. clinical importance)

**If reporting *P* values:**

- State hypothesis/es of interest
- Report calculated *P* value rather than threshold (i.e. *P* = 0.032 rather than *P* < 0.05)

##Some examples of poor practice

##Reporting guidelines in the medical research field

<p align="center">
![](C:\Users\gille\Downloads\equator_logo.PNG)

- Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research
<div class="blue2">*www.equator-network.org*</div>

- Guidelines for various study designs, topics, and clinical areas

- Catchy acronyms!
<div class="blue2">*e.g. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies*</div>

##Group discussion

<p align="center">
**Consider statistical methods and results as reported throughout publications in your own field...**
</p>

1. What are the positive aspects of reporting in your field?
2. How could reporting be improved?

##Summary

##Any questions?
